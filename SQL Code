Q1.What was the total sales revenue in 2020, and how did this compare to the year prior?  Are there any particular months that drove or hurt sales year-over-year? 

1)The total sales revenue in 2020:

SELECT ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity), 2) AS Total_Sales_Revenue, 2020 AS Year
FROM `dluxury.Sales` as ds
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Inventory` as di
ON ds.ProductId = di.ProductId
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Products` as dp
ON dp.ProductId = ds.ProductId
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2020

UNION ALL

SELECT ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity), 2), 2019
FROM `dluxury.Sales` as ds
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Inventory` as di
ON ds.ProductId = di.ProductId
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Products` as dp
ON dp.ProductId = ds.ProductId
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2019;


2)Year-over-year monthly sales analysis:

select EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ds.Date) AS Year,EXTRACT(MONTH FROM ds.Date) AS Month, round(SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity),2) as Revenue 
from `dluxury.Sales` as ds 
left join `dluxury.Inventory` as di on ds.ProductId = di.ProductId
left join `dluxury.Products` as dp on ds.ProductId = dp.ProductId 
WHERE
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM ds.Date) IN (2019, 2020)
GROUP BY YEAR,MONTH
order by Year, Month

Q2.What were the Top 5 Stores (based on revenue) in 2018 and what was their Inventory Sell-Through %? Please provide the store ID, store name, revenue, unit sales, inventory, and sell-through %.

select 
StoreName, 
di.StoreId, 
ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity), 2) as Revenue,
SUM(Quantity) AS Unit_Sales,
SUM(di.QuantityAvailable) AS Inventory, 
CONCAT(ROUND((SUM(Quantity) / (SUM(di.QuantityAvailable) + SUM(Quantity))) * 100, 2), '%') 
as Sell_Through_Rate
from `dluxury.Sales` as ds
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Inventory` as di
ON ds.ProductId = di.ProductId

LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Products` as dp
ON dp.ProductId = ds.ProductId
where EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2018
group by StoreName,di.StoreId
order by Revenue desc limit 5


Q3.What were the Top 5 Suppliers and each of their Top 5 Products (based on profit) in 2019?

SELECT 
dp.Supplier AS Supplier,
ROUND(SUM(ds.UnitPrice * ds.Quantity - dp.ProductCost * ds.Quantity),2) AS Profit
FROM
`dluxury.Sales` AS ds
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Inventory` as di
ON ds.ProductId = di.ProductId
LEFT JOIN `dluxury.Products` as dp
ON dp.ProductId = ds.ProductId
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM Date) = 2019
GROUP BY dp.Supplier
ORDER BY Profit DESC
LIMIT 5
